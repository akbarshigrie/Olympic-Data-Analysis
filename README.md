This project is an interactive Olympic data analysis dashboard built using Python. It explores various aspects of Olympic history, including age distribution of gold medal winners, trends in female participation, gold medals won by athletes over the age of 50, and weight trends in male weightlifters. The analysis is performed using powerful data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The visualizations are presented through a user-friendly web interface created with Gradio, allowing users to select and view different charts with ease. The project uses two datasets: athlete_events.csv, which contains detailed records of Olympic athletes, and noc_regions.csv, which maps National Olympic Committee (NOC) codes to their respective countries. This dashboard provides an insightful look into patterns and trends across the years of the Olympic Games.
